## About
A web browser inside a web browser. Its absurd isn't it? It's absolutely the wrong tool for the job: it's even in Python. Let's ignore those websites that let you use a virtual web browser as per virtual machines on the web, no we don't need to remember those.

## Installation
Our project relies on the `uv` Python package and project manager.

pip install uv
```
After installing `uv`, packages should get synced with the virtual environment.
```
uv sync
```
Now, you should be able to run the project.
```
uv run main.py
```
